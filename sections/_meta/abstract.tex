\section*{Abstract}
Voxelization is the process of converting 3D models into volumetric data. The main goal of this thesis is to improve the the open-source Voxelizer engine, which is written in JavaScript. To make voxelization easy and available, a complementary cross-platform desktop application is also developed, making use of the Voxelizer engine. Further, to make the software secure and easy to maintain, this thesis also focus on automation. A GitHub Action named JSDoc Action is developed for the purpose of automating the generation of JSDoc documentation. The results of this thesis includes a maintainable and easy to use collection of high-quality voxelization software, in addition to several automation tools.
