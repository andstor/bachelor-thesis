\section*{Abstract}
This report concerns the improvement and development of several projects related to voxelization. Voxelization is the process of converting 3D models into a volumetric data. The main focus is dedicated to the improvements of the open-source Voxelizer engine, written entirely in JavaScript. To make voxelization easily available, a complementary cross platform desktop application is also developed, making use of the Voxelizer engine. Further, to make the software more secure and easy to maintain, this report also focus on automation. Especially, a GitHub Action named JSDoc Action is developed for the purpose of automating the generation of JSDoc documentation. The results of this thesis includes a high-quality, maintainable and easy to use eco-system of voxelization software written in JavaScript, alongside several automation tools.

%Here you give a summary of your your work and your results. This is like a management summary and should be written in a clear and easy language, without many difficult terms and without abbreviations. Everything you present here must be treated in more detail in the main report. You should not give any references to the report in the summary -- just explain what you have done and what you have found out. The Summary and Conclusions should be no more than two pages.
