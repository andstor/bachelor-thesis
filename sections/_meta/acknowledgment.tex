\section*{Acknowledgement}
I wish to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Ricardo da Silva Torres, for all the help and guidance throughout the entire project. I also want to acknowledge all the love and support from my family - my parents, Synnøve and Ove; and my sisters, Maria, Viktoria and Helene. They all kept me going, and this work would not have been possible without them.
