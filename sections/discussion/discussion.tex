\subsection{three-voxel-loader}
\subsubsection{Performance}

The three-voxel-loader plugin generates a cube buffergeometry for every voxel. Even for voxels that are not visible from outside the model. When loading a large and filled voxel model, this results in an enourmous number of faces being rendered, putting a heavy load on the hardware. A future improvement could be to only render a shell geometry based on the voxel "cubes". This would dramatically reduce the number of triangles needed to render the voxel model.
